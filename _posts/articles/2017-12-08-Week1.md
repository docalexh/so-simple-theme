For the most unwell patients we look after, time critical decisions are paramount to their survival. The whole construct of a hospital is about getting the right patient, in the right place at the right time to access the right treatment. Different parts of the hospital are set up to accommodate these needs, with the sickest patients in the most intensively monitored areas.

I'm sure that you can anticipate that this is much harder than it sounds. In a system with limited resources, under strain by lots of unwell patients, how do we decide which individuals to assign our precious resources? Moreover there is a very real risk of iatrogenic harm when treating our most unwell patients. Thus we need to make sure that the treatments we offer are appropriate so that we do the right thing for both the individual and the population.

In an ideal world you'd assign the most resources to patients who you knew:
- a) needed them most (were sickest)
- b) would benefit from them most (so that what you do will make a difference)
- c) at the right time
- d) for just long enough to have a complete effect (to be most financially efficient).

The reality is we constantly struggle to fulfil these targets relying frankly on guesswork. So is there a more accurate way to make these decisions for our patients...?

In any given 24 hour period our intensive care unit collects approximately 15000 pieces of data on the most unwell patients. Data science (the process of analysing data) brings a completely new approach to traditional analysis of this data. Current real time analysis is predominantly from a senior doctor's interpretation of that collected data. This in turn is largely based upon an expert opinion of a body of doctors. However, a data science strategy is much more powerful than this. It utilises all the collected data and applies mathematical and statistical theory to tackle problems. It helps to achieve both precision medicine (using data to tailor treatments to patients) and the creation of learning systems (helping to predict outcomes and identify specific areas for improvement).

Imagine if we could accurately tell our patients and their families their predicted mortality, the likely benefit of treatment and know the cost of treating them. Imagine if we had a system that could accurately flag up a deteriorating hospital patient and tell us not only if a patient needs treating, but when.


With the advent of wearable tech we're collecting more health data than ever before. The role of data science in health is to learn how to interpret this data.

Imagine if your watch said:

"Morning John,"

"You achieved 4 hours of level 2 sleep last night. Your current life expectancy is 	calculated at 438,297 hours remaining."

John shakes his head. The Christmas party had been an unexpectedly larger one than that he had planned for last night. It had cost him a good few hours of life expectancy. Not to worry though, an extra run, actually making his yoga class this week and skipping Friday's takeaway for a salad and he would get his time back up.


You might think we're a long way off but it's much closer than you might assume. Soon hospitals will electronically track all of their admitted patients. Soon we'll better understand all the data collected by your smart phone/ smart watch. Teams of doctors and data scientists have collaborated to create models to better understand the data we already collect to; better treat their patients, to predict mortality in hospitalised patients, to predict their length of stay.  The only real difficulty is convincing bright minds that they'd rather want to work for the NHS than Google....
