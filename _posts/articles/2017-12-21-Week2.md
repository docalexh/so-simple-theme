I get lonely when I haven’t talked to anyone for a day, but shockingly, over one million older people will go over a month without talking to a relative, friend or neighbour.  Loneliness is an emotional imbalance between a persons desired and achieved level of social interactions.  This is why you might feel lonely in a crowd of people or in a busy city, but connected in some of the most remote places on the planet. To avoid being lonely we need to have meaningful interactions. In turn allowing us to feel fulfilled, reduce stress and promote healthier behaviours.

In a world where more people have access to a mobile phone than a flushing toilet, technology and social media can make meaningful interactions harder. Social media increases a person's desired social need without a meaningful interaction. I recently downloaded an app, called ‘Moment’, which monitors the time I spend on my mobile phone. On average I spend between 1.5-3 hours a day on my phone. Days with the highest phone usage correlate well with days that I have had less physical/social interaction and my mood has generally been lower on these days.

My personal habits match the recent report from San Diego University stating that increased time spent in front of a screen might have contributed to an increase in symptoms of depression in young American people, especially girls. These surveys were collected between 2010-2015 involving 500,000 teenagers. We have also been warned about the negative impact that late night screen time can have on our sleep pattern.

We need to be monitoring and educating our children on social media as loneliness becomes a modern-day epidemic. You can create an identity online, and be whoever you want to be. Someone could perceive that you are very popular because you have 81 likes on Instagram, while you're sitting in your bedroom, alone, longing for a friendship. It’s these perceived interactions, that increase someone’s social isolation.  As a generation who have known life with and without a mobile phone, we need to ensure that our children do not try to meet their desired social need with technology. It is vital that a  physical social interaction is continued for a healthy development. And moreover these are becoming harder and harder to find. Previously a bus journey might have been an opportune moment to strike up a conversation with a stranger for 20 minutes. Now, your chances of having a conversation are next to nothing unless you are going to tap someone on the shoulder and ask them to stop looking at Facebook and take their headphones off.

For the older generation, purchasing a mobile phone may allow connection between friends and family members that they otherwise may not hear from in weeks.  At the same time this shouldn't be used as a substitute to reduce meaningful interactions from those around us.

So what now?  Think about how you use technology and social media over the festive period. Download ‘Moment’. Spend an hour less a day on your phone and get 7 hours extra in your week to help reduce loneliness. What will you do with that extra time? See your gran? Invite someone for tea? Become a befriender at Age UK?  Next time you’re on the bus or tube, ask yourself… would I know what colour coat the person sitting next to them was wearing today? If the answer is no- time to pop down the phone and start looking around you.

And if that’s all a bit much to do at the moment then start off simple…the next time you walk past someone in the street- look up from your phone- and use the 17 muscles to smile (it’s better exercise than texting) and might be the first connection the other person has had all week.

*Ruby Groome is a doctor who knows there isn’t a word in the English language that means ‘the opposite of loneliness’, but thinks that there probably should be…*
